# Chess
A program to simulate and manage chess games. 

Supply moves in the algebraic chess notation (source square, destination square), where a square is referred to using a letter in the range A-H and a number in the range 1-8. 

The program will keep track of the state of the game, detecting when the game is over and producing appropriate output to the user.
